Differential testing
--------------------

Single tests per gene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How to perform likelihood-ratio tests `lrt <https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/tutorials/test/single/likelihood_ratio_test.ipynb>`__.

How to perform Wald tests `wald <https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/tutorials/test/single/wald_test.ipynb>`__.

How to perform Wilcoxon tests `wilcoxon <https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/tutorials/test/single/wilcoxon_test.ipynb>`__.

Map single tests across partitions of data set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set up a test and conduct test for each gene in each cluster or each sample etc.
We show an example for doing this for a t-test in `partition <https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/tutorials/test/single/run_by_partition.ipynb>`__.
   
Multiple tests per gene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How to perform pairwise tests `pairwise <https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/tutorials/test/multi/pairwise.ipynb>`__.

How to perform group versus rest tests `versus_rest <https://github.com/theislab/diffxpy/tutorials/test/multiversus_rest.ipynb>`__.
