Differential testing
--------------------

We grouped tutorials by differential expression concepts:

`Introduction <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/introduction_differential_testing.ipynb>`__ to differential expression testing.

Differential expression analysis with `continuous <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/modelling_continuous_covariates.ipynb>`__ covariates such time, concentration, pseudotime or space.

How to run `multiple <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/multiple_tests_per_gene.ipynb>`__ tests per gene.


Additionally, we also provide links to tutorials that discuss specific concepts as a subset of the tutorial:

Single tests per gene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How to perform likelihood-ratio tests `lrt <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/introduction_differential_testing.ipynb>`__.

How to perform `wald <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/introduction_differential_testing.ipynb>`__ tests for a single parameter.

How to perform Wald tests for `multiple <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/introduction_differential_testing.ipynb>`__ parameters.

How to perform t-`tests <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/introduction_differential_testing.ipynb>`__.

How to perform `wilcoxon <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/introduction_differential_testing.ipynb>`__ (rank sum) tests.

Map single tests across partitions of data set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Diffxpy allows you to define a data set partition and to conduct test on each gene in each partition. This is shown`here <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/multiple_tests_per_gene.ipynb>`__.
   
Multiple tests per gene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How to perform `pairwise tests, group versus rest tests and tests within each parition  <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/multiple_tests_per_gene.ipynb>`__ tests.


Gene set enrichment: enrich
---------------------------

How to conduct a gene set enrichment workflow `enrich <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/enrich/enrich.ipynb>`__.


Example work-flows on real data sets
------------------------------------

Will be added soon.
